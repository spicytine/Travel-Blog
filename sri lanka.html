        <p class="w3-bold w3-text-brown w3-large">When is the best time to visit Sri Lanka?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify">The best time to visit Sri Lanka is from December to March, when the weather is dry and sunny, making it ideal for exploring the beaches, cultural sites, and wildlife. For those looking to visit the central highlands, the months of April to September are more favorable, as the cooler climate makes it comfortable for hiking and sightseeing. However, since Sri Lanka experiences two monsoon seasons, expect some rain in the southwest from May to September, and in the northeast from October to January. Regardless, there's never a bad time to visit this tropical paradise!</p><br>

        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-center">The Temple of the Tooth in Kandy is one of Sri Lanka's most sacred sites, housing the revered relic of the Buddha's tooth. Known for its stunning architecture and spiritual significance, the temple offers a peaceful and reflective experience. Visitors can admire the intricate designs, witness traditional rituals, and feel the serenity of this important religious center. It‚Äôs a must-visit for anyone wanting to connect with Sri Lanka's rich Buddhist heritage.</p><br>  
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-bold w3-large">BEST TIME TO VISIT THE TEMPLE</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-center">The best time to visit the Temple of the Tooth is during the dry months, from <b>November to April,</b> when the weather is pleasant for sightseeing. However, the temple is open year-round, so you can visit any time. If you want to experience Kandy at its cultural peak, consider timing your visit with the Esala Perahera festival in July or August, when the temple hosts grand processions and ceremonies in honor of the sacred relic.</p><br>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-bold w3-large">HOW TO GET TO THE TEMPLE OF TOOTH</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-bold w3-large" style="margin-left: 50px;">Start from Colombo</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">To get to the Temple of the Tooth from Colombo, you can choose between train, bus, or private transport.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">üìç <b>Train:</b> Head to Colombo Fort Station, where you can catch a direct train to Kandy. The train ride takes around 3-4 hours and offers scenic views of Sri Lanka's countryside, making it a popular choice. The trains run regularly throughout the day.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">üìç <b>Bus:</b> Buses also depart from Colombo Bus Terminal and take around 3-4 hours. Buses are affordable and reliable but might not offer the same scenic experience as the train.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">üìç <b>Private transport: </b>If you prefer a more comfortable and quicker option, you can hire a taxi or rent a car. This will take approximately 3-4 hours, depending on traffic.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-bold w3-large" style="margin-left: 50px;">Arrive in Kandy</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Upon reaching Kandy, you will arrive at either the <b>Kandy Bus Station or Kandy Railway Station. </b> Both are located within a short distance from the city center.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">üìç From the bus or train station, you can take a taxi or tuk-tuk to the temple. This ride should take around 10-15 minutes, depending on traffic.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-bold w3-large" style="margin-left: 50px;">Reaching the Temple of the Tooth</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">üìç The Temple of the Tooth is located in the heart of Kandy, <b>near the Kandy Lake.</b> It‚Äôs a prominent landmark, so it‚Äôs easy to spot. If you're unfamiliar with the area, simply ask the locals or follow the signs leading to the temple.</p><br>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify w3-italic" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"> Once you reach the temple, be sure to <b>dress modestly</b> as a sign of respect (shoulders and knees should be covered). The temple is open daily, but if you want to experience a special ceremony, consider visiting during the <b>Esala Perahera festival </b> (usually held in July or August), a grand procession that includes traditional dances, drumming, and the relic being paraded</p>

        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-center w3-bold w3-xlarge">Understanding Sri Lanka's Cultural Etiquette and Customs</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Sri Lanka is a beautiful island nation rich in tradition, shaped by its Buddhist heritage and diverse ethnic communities, including Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims. Understanding local customs and etiquette will help you connect with locals and enjoy a more respectful and meaningful visit.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">In Sri Lanka, politeness, modesty, and respect play a central role in daily interactions. A common greeting is saying ‚ÄúAyubowan‚Äù with palms pressed together in front of the chest, especially in more traditional settings. Handshakes are also common, particularly among men, but it's best to wait and see how someone greets you first. Physical contact between opposite genders in public is generally avoided.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">When visiting religious sites like Buddhist temples, dressing modestly is important. Shoulders and knees should be covered, and shoes and hats must be removed before entering. Never point your feet at religious objects or turn your back to a Buddha statue when taking photos. It‚Äôs also considered disrespectful to touch or lean on sacred items.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Public behavior is expected to be calm and respectful. Loud conversations or displays of anger are frowned upon. Using your right hand when giving or receiving items, especially food, is a common cultural practice, as the left hand is seen as less clean. Respect for elders is deeply rooted in Sri Lankan culture, and offering seats, speaking respectfully, and allowing them to begin meals first are simple but appreciated gestures.</p><br>
