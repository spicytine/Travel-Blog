        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-center w3-bold w3-xlarge">UNDERSTANDING KUWAIT'S CULTURAL ETIQUETTE AND CUSTOMS</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Kuwait, with its rich Islamic traditions, has a distinct set of cultural customs that visitors should be aware of to ensure a respectful and enjoyable visit.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">In Kuwait, greetings are typically formal. A handshake is common between men, but it‚Äôs important to be mindful of cultural differences, particularly when greeting women. A nod or bow is often used instead of a handshake with women, and in some cases, a handshake may not be appropriate. Additionally, it is polite to greet people with titles such as ‚ÄúSheikh‚Äù or ‚ÄúSayyid‚Äù when addressing someone with respect.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Dress modestly while in public spaces, as Kuwait is a conservative country. Women are often seen wearing a hijab, and it‚Äôs advised that both men and women cover their shoulders and knees to show respect. Public behavior is crucial, and public displays of affection should be avoided. It is also essential to be respectful to elders and avoid raising your voice or showing frustration in public.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-brown w3-justify" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">During the holy month of Ramadan, respect for fasting is particularly important. It‚Äôs courteous to avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in public during the daytime, as many locals fast during this time. Understanding and adhering to these customs will ensure a more positive and respectful interaction with the people of Kuwait.</p>
